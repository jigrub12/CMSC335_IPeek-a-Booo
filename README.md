**App Description**: [https://cmsc335-ipeek-a-booo.onrender.com/](https://cmsc335-ipeek-a-booo.onrender.com/)

Allows users to enter IP Address through a form and gives info on its location and co-ordinates.

The IPV4 Address format is a dotted quad or dotted decimal, is x.x.x.x

There are additional pages, which show the most searched IP Addresses and a list of all IP Addresses searched.

Additional Note: In Function to calculate distance between two coordinates, we calculate the distance between the current user on the website //and the ip address mentioned. However, if you host the website locally, it will default to google's IP Address for your IP address, since the distance functionality is only for once the website renders.
