<p>Allows users to enter IP Address through a form and gives info on its location and co-ordinates.</p>
<p>The IPV4 Address format is a dotted quad or dotted decimal, is x.x.x.x</p>
<p>There are additional pages, which show the most searched IP Addresses and a list of all IP Addresses searched.</p>
<p>Additional Note: In Function to calculate distance between two coordinates, we calculate the distance between the current user on the website
//and the ip address mentioned. However, if you host the website locally, it will default to google&#39;s IP Address for your IP address, since the distance functionality is only for once the website renders.</p>
